 * Commentary to a saving procedure

 * 1) In child entity class you need to have a constructor
 * with the reference of type of owner of the relationship
 * among its arguments.
 *
 * 2) You should not save child entity at first.
 *
 * 3) When you pass a list of child entities to a corresponding setter of
 * your main entity (to the owner of the relationship) and perform a save
 * operation, Spring Data JPA will trigger assignments to all
 * fields that represent interconnections between entities that
 * rely on main entity which is being passed.
